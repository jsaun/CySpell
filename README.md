SE329 Group 3 Project

To Add to this Project:

Clone the project to your computer
* You will now have a new directory that contains a .git file

If using Terminal:
* git checkout master
  (Make sure you are on the Master Branch)
* git pull
  (This pulls down any of the latest changes if any)
* git checkout -b dev/YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
  (This allows a new branch to be created that only you work on)

When done writing code
* git add . or git add --all .
  (Adds all added/modified files or all added/modified/deleted files)
* git commit
  (Throws the commit into VI/Nano, use 'I' to insert a commit message, then hit 'ESC', then Save it ':wq')
  (Git knows once the file is saved what to do with it, dont' need to go look for it)
* git push
  (This pushes your local commit to the remote (In this case GitHub's urls))
  (If it asks to set-upstream, usually just copying and pasting its example will be enough to set the remote)


Helpful tips:
* git branch
  (Shows you what branch you are on and which ones you have locally)
* git status
  (Shows any changes or status of the branch)
